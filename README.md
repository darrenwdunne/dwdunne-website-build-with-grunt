Darren Dunne's web page

This version is built using Grunt.
Open the index-min.html in the /dist directory to view it.

to build the site, simply run in the project directory:

```
grunt
```

## Why?
I created this to explore the differences between Gulp and Grunt and the pros/cons of each for Front End Web Development.  

## Conclusion?
I much preferred developing with JavaScript in Gulp over the properties files in Grunt.
